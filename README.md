# Assembly Model of Brain Computation

This repository contains Python implementations for simulating neural computation using the assembly model of the brain. This computational framework models how groups of neurons (assemblies) in different brain areas interact, form memories, and process information.

## Overview

The assembly model is based on the idea that cognition emerges from the dynamic formation and interaction of neural assemblies across different brain areas. This codebase provides tools to:

- Simulate neural areas with configurable parameters
- Model synaptic plasticity and learning
- Study memory formation and pattern completion
- Investigate language acquisition and syntax processing
- Analyze convergence properties and stability

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib pptree
```

### Basic Usage

Start with a simple projection simulation:

```python
import brain
import simulations

# Run a basic projection simulation
results = simulations.project_sim(n=100000, k=1000, p=0.01, beta=0.05, t=50)
print("Assembly sizes over time:", results)
```

## Key Concepts

### Brain Areas
Each area has:
- `n`: Total number of neurons
- `k`: Number of neurons that fire (winners)
- `beta`: Plasticity parameter controlling learning rate
- `p`: Sparsity/connectivity parameter

### Projections
- **Feedforward**: `brain.project({"stimulus": ["area_A"]}, {})`
- **Recurrent**: `brain.project({}, {"area_A": ["area_A"]})`
- **Cross-area**: `brain.project({}, {"area_A": ["area_B"], "area_B": ["area_A"]})`

### Assembly Formation
Repeated stimulation causes:
1. Winner selection (top-k neurons fire)
2. Synaptic strengthening between winners
3. Assembly stabilization over time
4. Pattern completion capabilities

## Example Experiments

### 1. Basic Assembly Formation
```python
import brain

b = brain.Brain(p=0.01)
b.add_stimulus("stim", k=100)
b.add_area("A", n=10000, k=100, beta=0.05)

# Repeated stimulation forms stable assembly
for i in range(20):
    b.project({"stim": ["A"]}, {"A": ["A"]})
    print(f"Round {i}: Assembly size = {b.areas['A'].w}")
```

### 2. Memory Association
```python
import simulations

# Study how two stimuli become associated
results = simulations.association_sim(
    n1=100000, n2=100000, k=1000, p=0.01, beta=0.05
)
```

### 3. Language Learning
```python
import learner

# Train brain to distinguish verbs from nouns
brain = learner.LearnBrain(beta=0.05, LEX_k=100)
brain.train_simple(30)
brain.test_word("CAT")  # Should activate noun areas
brain.test_verb("RUN")  # Should activate verb areas
```

## Running Experiments

Most simulation functions return data that can be analyzed:

```python
import simulations
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Study convergence for different plasticity values
results = simulations.project_beta_sim(n=100000, k=317, p=0.01, t=100)

# Plot convergence curves
for beta, assembly_sizes in results.items():
    plt.plot(assembly_sizes, label=f'Î²={beta}')
plt.xlabel('Time Steps')
plt.ylabel('Assembly Size')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

## Advanced Features

- **Explicit vs. Sparse Simulation**: Choose between full neuron tracking or efficient sparse computation
- **Multi-area Networks**: Connect multiple brain regions with configurable connectivity
- **Custom Plasticity Rules**: Define area-specific learning parameters
- **Bilingual Modeling**: Study language interaction and interference
- **Syntax Processing**: Model grammatical rule acquisition and application

## Contributing

When adding new simulations:
1. Follow the naming convention: `*_sim.py` for simulation libraries
2. Include docstrings explaining parameters and expected outputs
3. Add tests to validate new functionality
4. Use the existing `Brain` and `Area` classes as building blocks
